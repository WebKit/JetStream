# Web Tooling Benchmark

This is a clone/fork of the original [Web Tooling Benchmark](https://github.com/v8/web-tooling-benchmark).
Unlike the original, this is a JetStream-oriented version.

This benchmark provides workloads for common web tools.


## Build Instructions

```bash
# install required node packages.
npm ci
# build the workload, output is ./dist
npm run build
```
